//! An introduction to netmachines.
//!
//! <i>This module does not contain any code, only a lot of text.</i>
//!
//! This module introduces the reader to the *netmachines* crate. Since it
//! is built on a stack of other crates and makes no attempt in hiding the
//! fact, this introduction starts out with short introduction to these
//! other building blocks: we will start by introducing [mio] and [rotor]
//! before moving on to *netmachines* proper.
//!
